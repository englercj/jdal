jDal - A JavaScript Database Abstraction Library
=======================
This project's purpose is to abstract client-side database access across all major browsers. 
This current repo is a PoC for my Software Engineering II class, since the project is extremely time-boxed the "library"
will be feature starved and not written in the best, most *extensible* way possible.
